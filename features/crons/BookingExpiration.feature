      | askerEmail          | asker@kisaan.rocks   |
      | askerPassword       | 12345678               |

      | start               | 1                      |
      | end                 | 3                      |
      | start_time          | 00:00                  |
      | end_time            | 00:00                  |
      | amountExpected      | 300                    |
      | feesExpected        | 30                     |
      | totalAmountExpected | 330                    |

    When I run "kisaan:bookings:expire" command
    Then I should see "1 booking(s) expired" on console
    And He should receive the "booking_request_expired_offerer" mail on "offerer@kisaan.rocks"
    And He should receive the "booking_request_expired_asker" mail on "asker@kisaan.rocks"
