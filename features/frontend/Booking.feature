      | Listing One  | 4   | 1      | 15000 |

  Scenario: As asker i can find a listing so that i can make a booking request

    And I do a search on the home page
    And I find a listing which "listing title" equal to "Listing One"

    #When I am on the "listing show" page which "listing title" equal to "Listing One"

    #Wait ajax booking price result
    And I wait 3000 ms
    When I fill date range with the following:
      | start-date | 4 |
      | end-date   | 6 |
    #Wait ajax booking price result
    And I wait 3000 ms
    Then I should see "300" in the ".add-info .price" element
    When I follow "Book now"
    Then I should be on this new booking page:
      | listingTitle | Listing One |
      | start        | 4           |
      | end          | 6           |

    When I fill in "message" with "Hello, I want to book your listing"
    And I fill correctly credit card informations
    And I check hidden "I accept the terms of use"
    And I press "Validate booking"
    And I eventually retry new booking request if first card failed
    Then I should be on "https://3ds-acs.test.modirum.com/mdpayacs/pareq"
    When I fill in "password" with "secret3"
    And I press "Submit"
    Then I should be on the page which route name is "dashboard_booking_show_asker"
    And I should see "330" in the ".post [data-id=booking-total]" element
    And I should receive the "booking_request_asker" mail on "asker@kisaan.rocks"
